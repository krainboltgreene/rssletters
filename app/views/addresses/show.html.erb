<h1>Address</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Email</strong>: <%= @address.to_email %> <em>Don't share this with anyone!</em>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Provider</strong>: <%= @address.provider.name %>
  <% if @address.provider.advanced? %>
    (Advanced)
  <% end %>
</p>

<% unless @address.confirmed? %>
  <p>
    We're not sure if you've confirmed your address. If you have confirmed your address just ignore this and the next email will automatically mark it as confirmed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do need to confirm your email address just look at the first message we received:
  </p>

  <%= @address.newsletters.first.body.html_safe %>

  <p>
    If you see a confirmation link, just click that!
  </p>
